# Awesome-Sign-Language

Why interesting? Language is abstractive and videos are dense, while sign language bridges ``low-level'' vision and ``high-level'' language. Eveyone could somehow understand sign language. 

It is worth noting that different culture also raise difference. 
For instance, Shaking heads mean ``Yes'' in India.
